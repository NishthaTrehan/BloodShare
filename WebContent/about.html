                    <p>A blood share is a center where blood gathered as a result of blood donation,
                        stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion. The term "blood bank"
                        typically refers to a division of a hospital where the storage of blood product 
                        occurs and where proper testing is performed (to reduce the risk of transfusion 
                        related adverse events). However, it sometimes refers to a collection center, and 
                        indeed some hospitals also perform collection.
                        While the first blood transfusions were made directly from donor to receiver before coagulation,
                        it was discovered that by adding anticoagulant and refrigerating the blood it was possible to 
                        store it for some days, thus opening the way for the development of blood banks.
                        John Braxton Hicks was the first to experiment with chemical methods to prevent the coagulation
                        of blood at St Mary's Hospital, London in the late 19th century. His attempts, using phosphate 
                        of soda, however, were unsuccessful.
